# Exploratory Data Analysis and Pandas Profiling Report on an Online Retail Store

## Introduction

Online retail stores generate vast amounts of data from various sources. Analyzing this data can help businesses gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and inventory management. This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis and generate a Pandas Profiling report on an Online Retail Store dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and sales trends.

## Dataset

The Online Retail Store dataset is a public dataset that contains information on customer transactions for an online retail store. The dataset contains 541,909 observations and 8 variables, including the target variable 'Quantity', which indicates the number of items purchased.

## Methodology

The following methodology was used in this project:

1. Importing Libraries: Libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas Profiling were imported for data manipulation, visualization, and profiling.

2. Loading the Dataset: The dataset was loaded using pd.read_csv() from the local computer.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset was explored to identify columns, unique values, missing values, shape of the entire dataset, info of the columns and data types, and statistical analysis of the data. Outliers were also identified in the dataset.

4. Relationship, Insights, and Visualizations: Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis techniques were used to visualize the data and identify patterns and trends. Relationships between variables were explored using scatterplots, boxplots, and heatmaps.

5. Pandas Profiling Report: A Pandas Profiling report was generated to provide a detailed overview of the dataset. The report includes information on variable types, missing values, correlations, distributions, and other statistical summaries.

## Results

The exploratory data analysis and Pandas Profiling report revealed several insights into customer behavior and sales trends:

- The majority of transactions were made by customers from the United Kingdom.
- The most frequently purchased items were 'WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER' and 'REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER'.
- The most profitable items were 'DOTCOM POSTAGE' and 'REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER'.
- Sales were highest in November and December.
- Sales were highest on Mondays and Tuesdays.
- Customers who made larger purchases tended to purchase more frequently.

These insights can help the online retail store develop strategies to increase sales and improve inventory management.

## Conclusion

Through exploratory data analysis and a Pandas Profiling report on the Online Retail Store dataset, we gained insights into customer behavior and sales trends. By understanding these factors, online retail stores can develop strategies to increase sales and improve inventory management.
